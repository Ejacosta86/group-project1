## Plan-your-KNIGHT

## Description 
This application is available for UCF students, family, and fans to access nearby available parking, tailgating, and restaurants. The map in the application showcases available locations for the user to view.

## Usage
Once on the application, the user can use the radio buttons to filter out nearby parking, tailgating, and restaurants. On the top Nav Bar, there is an "Account" section that the user can select. When selected, the user will be prompted to Login to their account. If the user does not have an account, at the bottom of the form, there is a button the user can click to simply sign up for an account. If the user logs in and types the wrong password, there will be an alert that states that the password is incorrect, and will work once the user types in the correct password. The motive of this application is for the user to be able to plan their night all in one place and be able to share their plans with their friends, and/or family. 
The Nav Bar also has links for local shows and major events that are nearby. When the link is selected, it will redirect the user to another page that shows them the calendar of local events and shows. There is also a "Discounts" tab available for UCF students to be redirected to a page to view student discounts.
